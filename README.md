In this Portfolio task, you will continue working with the dataset you have used in portfolio 2. 
But the difference is that the ratings have been converted to like (with score 1) and dislike (with score 0). 

Your task is to train classification models such as KNN to predict whether a user like or dislike an item.
Your high level goal in this notebook is to try to build and evaluate predictive models for 'rating' from other available features.
predict the value of the like (corresponding to rating 1) and dislike (corresponding to rating 0) in the data from some of the other fields.
